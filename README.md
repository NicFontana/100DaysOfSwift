# 100 Days Of Swift

I've finally decided to move on and start to pursue my interest in iOS development.

Apart from the [Stanford - Developing iOS 11 Apps with Swift](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-11-apps-with-swift/id1309275316) free course taught by the amazing Paul Hegarty, I've found this [100 Days Of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) freely offered by Paul Hudson (another great person of the Swift community) and I thought it could be a cool way to improve my learning process :rocket:.

I will use this repo to push my progress during this journey.

## Rules

1. Every day I spend one hour reading or watching Swift tutorials, or writing Swift code.
2. Every day I post about my progress to the social media site of my choosing. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nic_fontana) in this case.
